Everything between the initial meta data and the first post is considered an about section.

Yes, you can do *whatever* you want, as long as the [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-syntax.html][format]] supports it and it is not indicating a new post. This is just like any other post. You decide its content, the reader decides how they want it to be rendered.
